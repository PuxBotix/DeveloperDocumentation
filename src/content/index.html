section: ''
---


Sphero is a spherical robot toy designed by *Sphero* (the company). It is a white orb wrapped in polycarbonate plastic, capable of rolling around, changing colors, running programs, and being controlled by a smartphone or tablet.  Much like Sphero, Ollie and other robots developed by *Sphero* use the same methods for communicating and navigating, so programs developed for one robot will typically work on all *Sphero* robots.

* **Rolling** - Sphero robots can roll at a given speed and heading for a given amount of time.
* **Colors** - Sphero robots can light up in any color.*
* **Bluetooth** - Sphero robots connect to devices such an iPads, iPhones, and Android phones and tablets through Bluetooth.
* **Robot Languages** - Sphero robots support three 'onboard' programming languages.  Programs written in these languages are 'run' on the robot.
  * [Macros](/robot-languages/macros/) - proprietary Macro language
  * [OrbBasic](/robot-languages/orbbasic/) - Basic interpreter
  * [Oval](/robot-languages/oval-language/) - streaming C based language
